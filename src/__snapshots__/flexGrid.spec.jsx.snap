      Enzyme Internal Error: Enzyme expects an adapter to be configured, but found none. To
      configure an adapter, you should call \`Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() })\`
      before using any of Enzyme's top level APIs, where \`Adapter\` is the adapter
      corresponding to the library currently being tested. For example:

      import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-15';
