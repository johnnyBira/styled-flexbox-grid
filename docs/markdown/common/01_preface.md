**Styled Flexbox Grid** offers a flexible API that can be configured to cater any number of breakpoints.

```javascript
  <Column span={{ xs: 6, l: 4, xl: 3 }} />
```

The API is in large provided by [responsive-props](https://www.npmjs.com/package/responsive-props).
A detailed description of the API and how props can be structured can be found in the [readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/responsive-props) of **responsive-props**.
Every PropType in the documentation that is marked as "responsive-props" in the PropTypes table, accepts a responsive prop as it's value.
